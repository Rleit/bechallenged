Be Challenged, a inspired project by DailyUI.co but for Web Design students and creatives in web alike. 

## Description

This project was an idea I had during my studies. While getting emails from DailyUI for Daily exercises, personally felt that a simplified daily or bi-daily challenge for young website developers or even designers in code would be a great experience. As web development is ever expanding area being multidisiplinary is a goal, so the challenge list also involved design and even potentially print shop requirement based challenges.

On paper this is just a design and a concept with some testing on the backend. It requires a slight influx of cash to get the mail service off the ground. 

### Tech Used
HTML/CSS (Bootstrap Design Framework)
Email Campaign Manager MAUTIC through aws email cloud service. This potentially could be Mailchimp.
